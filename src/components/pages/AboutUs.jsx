                 <p>Since Bitcoin launched in 2009, over 10,000 crypto currencies have entered the market, and the total market capitalization for these coins has grown enormously in recent years: from approximately $20 Billion in February 2017 to over $2.3 Trillion in April 2021. The crypto market has a number of unique features. It is a high-volume, 24-hour market where most trading is done by retail investors. The coinsâ€™ fundamental values are impossible to determine. This leads to emotional trading and extremely high volatility, which is not correlated with traditional markets. This produces a market with considerable opportunities for arbitrage.
